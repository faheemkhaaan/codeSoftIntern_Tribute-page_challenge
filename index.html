        <h1>Mike Tyson</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Michael Gerard Tyson (born June 30, 1966) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to
            2005. Nicknamed Iron Mike and Kid Dynamite in his early career, and later known as The Baddest Man on the
            Planet. Tyson is regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He reigned as the
            undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by
            knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, 4 months, and 22 days old,
            Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title. He was the first
            heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, as well as the only heavyweight to
            unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael
            Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. In 1990, Tyson was knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas in
            one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
            Michael Gerard Tyson was born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on June 30, 1966. He has an older
            brother named Rodney (born c. 1961) and had an older sister named Denise, who died of a heart attack at age
            24 in February 1990. Tyson's mother, born in Charlottesville, Virginia,[23] was described as a promiscuous
            woman who might have been a prostitute.Tyson's biological father is listed as "Purcell Tyson", a "humble cab
            driver" (who was from Jamaica) on his birth certificate, but the man Tyson had known as his father was a
            pimp named Jimmy Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was from Grier Town, North Carolina (a predominantly black
            neighborhood that was annexed by the city of Charlotte), where he was one of the neighborhood's top baseball
            players. Kirkpatrick married and had a son, Tyson's half-brother Jimmie Lee Kirkpatrick, who would help to
            integrate Charlotte high school football in 1965. In 1959, Jimmy Kirkpatrick left his family and moved to
            Brooklyn, where he met Tyson's mother, Lorna Mae (Smith) Tyson. Kirkpatrick frequented pool halls, gambled
            and hung out on the streets. "My father was just a regular street guy caught up in the street world," Tyson
            said. Kirkpatrick abandoned the Tyson family around the time Mike was born, leaving Tyson's mother to care
            for the children on her own. Kirkpatrick died in 1992.

            The family lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant until their financial burdens necessitated a move to Brownsville when
            Tyson was 10 years old.Throughout his childhood, Tyson lived in and around neighborhoods with a high rate of
            crime. According to an interview in Details, his first fight was with a bigger youth who had pulled the head
            off one of Tyson's pigeons. Tyson was repeatedly caught committing petty crimes and fighting those who
            ridiculed his high-pitched voice and lisp. By the age of 13, he had been arrested 38 times. He ended up at
            the Tryon School for Boys in Johnstown, New York. Tyson's emerging boxing ability was discovered there by
            Bobby Stewart, a juvenile detention center counselor and former boxer. Stewart considered Tyson to be an
            outstanding fighter and trained him for a few months before introducing him to boxing manager and trainer
            Cus D'Amato. Tyson dropped out of high school as a junior. He was later awarded an honorary Doctorate in
            Humane Letters from Central State University in 1989. Kevin Rooney also trained Tyson, and he was
            occasionally assisted by Teddy Atlas, although Atlas was dismissed by D'Amato when Tyson was 15. Rooney
            eventually took over all training duties for the young fighter.

        <h2>Amateur career</h2>
        <p>
            As an amateur, Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympic Games, defeating Joe Cortez in 1981
            and beating Kelton Brown in 1982. Brown's corner threw in the towel in the first round. In 1984 Tyson won
            the gold medal at the Nation Golden Gloves held in New York, beating Jonathan Littles. He fought Henry
            Tillman twice as an amateur, losing both bouts by decision. Tillman went on to win heavyweight gold at the
            1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

        <h2>Early professional career</h2>
        <p>
            Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in Albany, New York. He defeated
            Hector Mercedes via first-round TKO.[28] He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting
            frequently, Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round.[39] The
            quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders,[39] like
            James Tillis, David Jaco, Jesse Ferguson, Mitch Green, and Marvis Frazier. His win streak attracted media
            attention and Tyson was billed as the next great heavyweight champion. D'Amato died in November 1985,
            relatively early into Tyson's professional career, and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to
            many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed.[40]

        <h2>Rising up Ranks</h2>
        <p>
            Tyson's first nationally televised bout took place on February 16, 1986, at Houston Field House in Troy, New
            York, against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson, and was carried by ABC Sports. Tyson knocked down
            Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson's nose.[41] During the sixth round,
            Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After
            admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to box, the referee finally stopped the fight near
            the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his
            opponent. The ruling was "adjusted" to a win by technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that
            a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable
            result.
        </p>

        <p>
            In July, after recording six more knockout victories, Tyson fought former world title challenger Marvis
            Frazier in Glens Falls, New York, on another ABC Sports broadcast. Tyson won easily, charging at Frazier at
            the opening bell and hitting him with two consecutive uppercuts, the second of which knocked Frazier
            unconscious thirty seconds into the fight.[42]
        </p>
        <p>

            After his win over Frazier, Tyson was booked to fight José Ribalta at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in
            Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1986.[43] Ribalta would hit Tyson in the body throughout the fight. Tyson
            knocked down Ribalta three times in the 2nd, 8th, and 10th round when the referee called the fight off.
            Tyson would go on to say that Ribalta was his toughest fight commenting, "I hit Jose Ribalta with
            everything, and he took everything and kept coming back for more. Jose Ribalta stood toe to toe with me. He
            was very strong in the clinches," and "Ribalta was a game fighter who actually engaged me. I felt nauseous
            from all Ribalta’s body blows, even hours after the fight. I never felt that much general pain again."[43]

        <p>
            On June 11, 2005, Tyson quit before the start of the seventh round in a close bout against journeyman Kevin
            McBride. In the 2008 documentary Tyson, he stated that he fought McBride for a payday, that he did not
            anticipate winning, that he was in poor physical condition and fed up with taking boxing seriously. After
            losing three of his last four fights, Tyson said he would quit boxing because he felt he had lost his
            passion for the sport.[147]

            In 2000 Tyson dismissed everyone who was working for him and enlisted new accountants, who prepared a
            statement showing he started the year $3.3 million in debt but earned $65.7 million.[148] In August 2007,
            Tyson pleaded guilty to drug possession and driving under the influence in an Arizona court, which stemmed
            from an arrest in December where authorities said Tyson, who has a long history of legal contentions,
            admitted to using cocaine that day and to being addicted to the drug.[149]

            In his 2013 autobiography Undisputed Truth, Tyson admitted to using the urine of his then wife Monica Turner
            to pass doping tests. He was married to Turner from 1997 to 2003. He also used his infant's urine for the
            same purpose.[150]

        <p>
            Tyson resides in Seven Hills, Nevada.[209] He has been married three times, and has seven children, one
            deceased, with three women; in addition to his biological children, Tyson includes his second wife's oldest
            daughter as one of his own.[210]

            Tyson married actress Robin Givens on February 7, 1988, at Holy Angels Catholic Church during a traditional
            ceremony in Chicago.[62][211] Givens was known at the time for her role on the sitcom Head of the Class.
            Tyson's marriage to Givens was especially tumultuous, with allegations of violence, spousal abuse, and
            mental instability on Tyson's part.[212]

        </div>
        <p>

        
            Matters came to a head when Tyson and Givens gave a joint interview with Barbara Walters on the ABC TV
            newsmagazine show 20/20 in September 1988, in which Givens described life with Tyson as "torture, pure hell,
            worse than anything I could possibly imagine."[213] Givens also described Tyson as "manic depressive" –
            which was later confirmed by doctors[214] – on national television while Tyson looked on with an intent and
            calm expression.[212] A month later, Givens announced that she was seeking a divorce from the allegedly
            abusive Tyson,[212] with the two officially separating on February 14, 1989.[62]

            Raised as a Catholic Tyson has stated that he converted to Islam before entering prison and that he
            made no efforts to correct what was reported in the media, although it was falsely reported that he
            converted to Islam during his time in prison and adopted the Muslim name Malik Abdul Aziz some sources
            report it as Malik Shabazz. Tyson never changed his given name to an Islamic one, despite the
            rumors.

            In November 2013, Tyson stated "the more I look into the churches and mosques for god, the more I start
            seeing the devil".[232] But, just a month later, in a December 2013 interview with Fox News, Tyson said that
            he is very grateful to be a Muslim and that he needs Allah in his life. In the same interview Tyson talked
            about his progress with sobriety and how being in the company of good people has made him want to be a
            better and more humble person.[233]
